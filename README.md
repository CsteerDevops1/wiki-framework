## Rules

All work, including comments on tickets, comments in the code are in English.

Spelling or grammar errors are "bugs" and must be "fixed." 

Data in the project can be in any languages. 

User interaction - through localization packages, default value = en US, but from the very beginning I would like to see ru RU available.
  
  
  ## Process
  
The master branch contains the official release history, and the develop branch serves as an integration branch for new features.
We do large features in our branches.
Then we do a pull request and someone watches the performance.
