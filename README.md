## Rules

All work, including comments on tickets, comments in the code are in English.

Spelling or grammar errors are "bugs" and must be "fixed." 

Data in the project can be in any languages. 

User interaction - through localization packages, default value = en US, but from the very beginning I would like to see ru RU available.
